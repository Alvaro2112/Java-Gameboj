# Gameboj

This is a java Game Boy emulator that works on your computer using your keyboard, it can load any game (White & Black).
The project has the necessary files to both run the Game Boy and test all of its components.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

I run this Java code using Eclipse so I will assume you will too,

1. First, you will have to clone the repository into your own machine.
2. After that you will have to download any Game Boy game you wish to play, in .gb format.
3. Afterwards, place the game at the same level as the src folder.
4. Now simply go to /Gameboj/src/ch/epfl/gameboj/gui/Main.java , right click, go to "run as" and then "Run configurations". Once this is done go to arguments in the 
menu box, to the right of main and insert the exact file name of your game, click apply and you are good to go, a screen with the game playing should appear.

# Gameboj Emulator Documentation

Gameboj is a Java-based emulator for the original Game Boy console, enabling keyboard play of classic black and white Game Boy games on your computer. This project was developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course in Java at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). The repository includes all necessary files for operating the emulator and for extensive testing of its components.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the below instructions to get the Gameboj emulator up and running on your local system for development or testing purposes. These instructions are specifically for the Eclipse IDE but they can be adapted to other environments.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Acquire a .gb Game Boy game file that you wish to play.
3. Place the game file in the directory at the same level as the 'src' folder.
4. Open `/Gameboj/src/ch/epfl/gameboj/gui/Main.java`, right-click, select "Run As" followed by "Run Configurations". In the configuration menu, navigate to the "Arguments" tab, input the exact name of your game file, apply the changes, and start the program. A window displaying the game should appear.
